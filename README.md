# AI-Powered Sales Forecasting & Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

## Overview

This is a Streamlit web app that allows users to:

- **Forecast future sales trends** using historical sales data with Prophet (time series forecasting).
- **Predict customer churn** using machine learning (XGBoost classifier) on customer data.

The app provides interactive visualizations and model performance insights to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Features

- Upload sales data CSV (columns: `Date`, `Sales`) to generate sales forecasts with confidence intervals.
- Upload customer churn dataset (with `Churn` target column) to train and test a churn prediction model.
- Visualize forecast trends and churn feature importance.
- Easy-to-use tabs for switching between forecasting and churn prediction.
- Built with Python, Streamlit, Prophet, XGBoost, and other popular data science libraries.
